# Kathleen N. — Final Portfolio Project

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hello! My name is Kathleen Nanquil, and I am currently a senior at Mt. Eden High School. This is my first year learning computer science, and everything—from HTML to JavaScript—was completely new to me at the start of the year. Despite the challenges, I pushed myself to grow by collaborating with classmates, practicing patience, and learning how to debug code more effectively. My journey as a student developer has been full of learning, persistence, and creativity.

## 📚 Project Overview

This final project is a portfolio website that showcases the coding projects I’ve created throughout the year. It serves not only as a collection of my work but also as a reflection of the skills and concepts I’ve developed in web development, including layout design, event handling, DOM manipulation, and interactivity. Throughout the year, I learned how the internet works, how to write clean and functional code, and how to problem-solve when things don't go as planned.

## 🌐 Portfolio Site Features

- A custom-designed "About Me" section
- A responsive layout with screenshots and descriptions of featured projects
- Clickable project images that link directly to functional versions of each app
- Hover effects and styled components for a modern, clean appearance
- A “Back to Home” link on each project page for easy navigation

## 💡 Featured Projects

### 📝 To-Do List
An interactive list where users can add, mark, and delete tasks. Users can click once to cross out a completed task and double-click to remove it completely.

### 🎯 Hangman Game
A word guessing game where users choose from three categories (characters, books, desserts) and try to guess the hidden word before the hangman drawing is completed.

### 🧠 Memory Match
A card matching game with three difficulty levels. Users flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs while tracking moves and time.

### 🎡 Spin the Wheel Random Picker
Users can add their own labels to create a custom wheel. The wheel can be spun to randomly choose an item and reset at any time.
