      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        Hellooooo! My name is Kathleen Nanquil and I am a senior in Mt. Eden High School. This is my first year learning about computer science, so everything was completely new to me. I definitely struggled a lot, learning everything from the basics and building up skills as we moved on to more difficult topics, but I was able to do my best by collaborating with others and getting help from my classmates. There is so many different things that I learned over the year, but I think a few of the most important ones are about how the internet works, knowing how to use proper syntax when coding, finding errors in codes when debugging, and overall just being patient and attentive during the process.
